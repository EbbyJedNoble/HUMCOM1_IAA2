                        The game is played by at least two people.
                        Basing it on the name of the game, players have 3 weapons they can choose from: rock, paper, or scissors.
                        Each of weapon wins and loses against a specific weapon. So essentially it is a luck-based game.

                    The game is luck-based since noone is able to read people's minds.
                    But despite the game being decided by chance, there are few things that a player can do to possibly increase the chances of he/she winning.
                    We can try to:
                    <ul>
                        <li>Predict the opponent's patterns by analyzing what he chose based on the previous games/rounds he/she has played;</li>
                        <li>Use bluffs to possibly confuse your opponent; or</li>
                        <li>Just play very random by not thinking which can make it hard for the opponent whose trying to predict your pattern.</li>
                    </ul>

                        The first known mention of the game was in the book of <b>Wuzazu</b> which was written by the Chinese Ming-Dynasty <b>Xie Zhaozhi</b>.
                        It was stated in the book that the game dated back during the <b>Chinese Han Dynasty</b> (206 BC-220 BC).
                        The game was called <b>shoushiling</b> at that time.

                        The earliest form of the modern version of Rock Paper Scissors was created in Japan in the late 19th century, and it was called <b>Janken</b>.
                        Rock Paper Scissors had spread beyond Asia which was especially due to the increased Japanese contact with the west.

                        Up until now, the game is still very popular all over the world.
                        It is said that its success was due to the appeal of its simplicity which can be understood by any audience especially among children.
